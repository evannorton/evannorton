### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Evan, a game developer and full-stack developer based out of Chattanooga, TN. I've been a full-time software engineer since 2018. I currently work at City State Entertainment, primarily as a UI engineer for their titles Camelot Unchained and Final Stand: RagnarÃ¶k.

As an independent developer, I published an MMO project which I continue to maintain. I also participated in three game jams, each of my submissions winning awards.

I maintain the ["Pixel Pigeon" game engine](https://github.com/evannorton/pixel-pigeon) which I use to develop my games.
